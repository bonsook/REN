Version: 0.1.0
Author: Hardik Dixit , Shijia Wang, Bonsoo Koo, Cash Looi
Maintainer: Bonsoo Koo <bonsoo.koo@monash.edu> 
Description: The REN package provides tools for portfolio optimization using a combination of regularization techniques and ensemble methods. 
    It is designed to generate stable out-of-sample return predictions, particularly in the presence of strong correlations among assets. 
    The package includes functions for data preparation, parallel processing, and portfolio analysis using methods such as Mean-Variance, 
    James-Stein, LASSO, Ridge Regression, and Equal Weighting. Visualization and performance metrics such as Sharpe ratio, volatility, 
    and maximum drawdown are also provided to assess the results.
