## Resubmission
This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* written package names, software names and API (application
programming interface) names in single quotes in title and description.
e.g: --> 'REN'

* rewritten the description to remove "This package", package name,
title or similar.

* removed unnecessary spaces in the description field.

* replaced \dontrun with \donttest

* removed print(), replace with message().

* retained the dontrun directive in the ren function example because it requires importing large datasets like FF25, which would take too long to execute during checks.
